"I see ratings are bad for camera. But it is not that bad. It does some nice processing and gives sharp images.I give 4.3/5 . Everything is good, my only concern is battery, it gives only 5hr 30 min of screen on time for normal usage, I keep my battery between 20 and 80. What is the use of everything if we cant rely on its battery.",0.899080742413848,Positive
OS is very smooth and call quality is good. My only grouse is with the battery which is discharging very quickly. Does not even last 24 hrs with moderate use on 4G and will not last beyond 12-14 hrs with a normal 5g user. Hopefully some optimisation is done in the next software update. For those looking to buy a phone for parents can go ahead with 8gb/256gb.,0.8310114274420446,Positive
